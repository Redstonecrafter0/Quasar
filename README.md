# VulkanHelper

This repo is intended for me to learn Vulkan and to build a helper library around it
which I will use extensively throughout my future projects.

When this repo becomes a fully functional library it will still not be 1.0 so that
there is enough time to figure out what parts can be set to common defaults and what needs more granular control.
